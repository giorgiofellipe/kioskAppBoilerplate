Kiosk App Boilerplate
===================

Do you want to create a kiosk app? Start here!

This implements a few neat methods to prevent a user performing a particular action on the device when an application is running. The methods can be useful if you develop an app which is intended to be run on a device, temporarily given to a user. For instance, you may want to share a device to let the user find some information on a particular website, product or service.
